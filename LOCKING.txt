There are several relevant locks; these must be accessed in the appropriate order.

From first-to-last
1) The Classloader lock.
2) The IDMap instance lock.
     This protects the IDMap data structures that deal with mapping statements.
3) NumberedLogging.class
     This protects the per-statement state tables

Note that a consequence of this lock order is that at classloading time, it's possible to get locks on things, but that while holding locks on IDMap or NumberedLogging, it's NOT OK to load a class.

Also note that IDMap can tinker with the statement state, but not the other way around. This is required to support the special 'on' and 'off' tags

TODO:  Order of 2 and 3 can be changed, potentially.
