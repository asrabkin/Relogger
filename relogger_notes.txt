Several different numbering schemes.

Local numbers are per-file and per version.  Of the form (hash-of-file, id)

Global numbers are what's displayed. They are sequential. 

When software is produced, can construct an explicit map. Can update the map when
new code is seen.


When a new version is released, construct a map from NewLocal to Global.
Can just keep both maps; hash+id should make it unique.

Properties:

- if a code file is unchanged, numbers will always stay constant
- gracefully handles code not seen statically; assigns it a number the first
time and if the number is cached, will be stable forever.



Can do same trick for C via library interposition
same trick for python via loader? Cite SEJITS

8/22:

Listen thread is set. Table saving is set. Is enabled table is present.
Next steps:
	Slurping local-to-global mapping.
	Test script to show we can keep control of Hadoop classloading during MR job
	Performance microbenchmark
	Summarizing messages?

	Should lookup Frost logger	by	 carl de marken
	C is hard -- if statically linked, no library interposition.
	tag system and api aren't thought through yet	
	
9/13:
	Built microbenchmark.
Warmup made a big difference. JIT effect?
Raw Log4j no-log path is about 4ns
No-log path in my code is 40ns
Exit immediately with full code is 13 ns
Exit immediately with most of the if branches commented out drops to 3ns 

With short code but leaving in the dispatch table lookup is 29 ns
Full length without dispatch table is 15 ns

Conclusions:
	Dispatch table is 20-25 ns.
	Code length imposes about 10 nm
	Cascading 'if' itself is negligible


Factoring out log calls to functions and using case statement:
	Still 10ns of overhead over raw. Due to isEnabled() call?
	isEnabled, alone, costs 4ns

Tempting to just say "turn off log statement early, using the bitSet, so perf on log-not-taken doesn't mean anything."  But doesn't this mean we would need to hijack app calls to reset log priority?  

If willing to tolerate some unsoundness, can fix this by saying "recompute isEnabled table after every app-level call to update priorities."

BitSet copy is superfast -- half a microsecond. So with thousands of log statements, doing something for every log stmt once is O(millisecond)


DESIGN Q:
	Do we ignore user logger config or maintain it?  Maintaining means that we need to separate "turned off explicitly" from "implicitly"

Possibility:
	keep an explicit_disable. Locked around. Set by set() call and read by bulk_reupdate()
	cached_disable is set by set() and bulk_reupdate(), in a copy-on-write manner.
	read by logmsg.


Tried it. Pretty sure the cache-disable is working. But why is it still slow?  Reversing the initial way the bit is set causes a 10 ns shift.

9/18:
	Using dense integers for statement numbers allows better data structures:
	Using HashSet, is 7ns for toy perf test. Factor of 3.5?

-----

9/20:
	Timing is fixed!  Problem was the pass-by-array arg passing. Now at 2-ish ns, which is fast enough.
	Using a regular set instead of BitSet raises time to 7ish ns -- too much.

A potential unsoundness:  What if multiple logger values are passed to a given point? This is a strange style but not an impossible one, particularly in a wrapper context. 

Can audit for statically without too much pain. We can't check a load-time if there's an open universe and the logger is non-private.

Can punt by saying that we don't promise to maintain priorities set by legacy logger. Only best effort.

Difficulty testing with commons_log -- how to get output to stdout not stderr?  Probably via attribute setting?


Next thing to build:
	output first message, always?  Easy to do, by changing the way that cached_disable is implemented.


KEY RESEARCH Qs and CONTRIBUTIONS:
	Show that many problems with logging today are due to grouping messages by value, without an explicit identification of source.
	Show that we can retrofit a logging API, solving several practical problems, in ways that today's Aspect systems can't. (Log spew, message grouping)
	Show that we can handle version migrations gracefully using static analysis to extract templates, and then fuzzy-matching the templates.

Key ideas:
	Separate canonical from sequential names. Sequential names are more efficient at runtime since they allow dense data structures.

	BUG:  Javassist sometimes sees BCs out of order.
       Classhash plus BC in method isn't workable. Hash in method desc as well?
